# Azure Python Function with Async Processing

This repo contains a sample Python Azure Function that uses Asyncio. Gets a integer from the query string`count` and and returns the square of the number. If `count` is not passed, it defaults to `0`

1. ## 🧰 Prerequisites

   This demo, along with its instructions, scripts, and Bicep template, has been specifically designed to be executed in the `northeurope` region. However, with minimal modifications, you can also try running it in other regions of your choice (the specific steps for doing so are not covered in this context)

   - 🛠 Azure CLI Installed & Configured - [Get help here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
   - 🛠 Azure Function Core Tools - [Get help here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4%2Cwindows%2Ccsharp%2Cportal%2Cbash#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
   - 🛠 Bicep Installed & Configured - [Get help here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)
     - 🛠 [Optional] VS Code & Bicep Extenstions - [Get help here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#vs-code-and-bicep-extension)
   - `jq` - [Get help here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
   - `bash` or git bash - [Get help here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. ## ⚙️ Setting up the environment

   - Get the application code

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/miztiik/azure-function-http-trigger-async-function.git
     cd azure-function-http-trigger-async-function
     ```

3. ## 🚀 Prepare the local environment

   Ensure you have jq, Azure Cli and bicep working

   ```bash
   jq --version
   func --version
   bicep --version
   bash --version
   az account show
   ```

4. ## 🚀 Deploying the Solution

      Initiate the deployment with the following command,

      ```bash
      # make deploy
      sh deployment_scripts/deploy.sh
      ```

      After successfully deploying the stack, Check the `Resource Groups/Deployments` section for the resources.

5. ## 🔬 Testing the solution

   - **Trigger the function**

      ```bash
      FUNC_URL="https://async-fn-http-trigger-store-backend-fn-app-002.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger"
      curl ${FUNC_URL}?count=10
      ```

      You should see an output like this,

      ```json
      {
      "status": true,
      "recv_num": 100,
      "num_sqr": 10000,
      "processed_on": "2023-05-25 13:06:59"
      }
      ```

6. ## 📒 Conclusion

   In this demonstration, we showcase how to setup azure function with async processing. This can be used to process large number of requests in a short period of time.
  
7. ## 🧹 CleanUp

   If you want to destroy all the resources created by the stack, Execute the below command to delete the stack, or _you can delete the stack from console as well_

   - Resources created during [Deploying The Solution](#-deploying-the-solution)
   - _Any other custom resources, you have created for this demo_

   ```bash
   # Delete from resource group
   az group delete --name Miztiik_Enterprises_xxx --yes
   # Follow any on-screen prompt
   ```

   This is not an exhaustive list, please carry out other necessary steps as maybe applicable to your needs.

## 📌 Who is using this

This repository aims to show how to Bicep to new developers, Solution Architects & Ops Engineers in Azure.
